# unitTestExample
Just an example of unitTest on Symfony2 with PHPunit

This test is not functional because i had deleted some entities/datas.
This is an example to how you can call a private method for unit testing.

## This test contains:

One example for testing a controller
```
Controller\ExampleController.php
```
One example for testing a service
```
Service\SelectTag.php
```

More example are coming...
